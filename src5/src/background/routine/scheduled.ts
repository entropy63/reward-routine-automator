// The scheduled run (user request, 2026-09-12): fire the startup routine once
// a day at the user-specified time, in a browser that never closes and
// reopens. The once-per-day logic itself stays where it lives
// (runStartupSequence's lastRoutineDay gate) — this driver is only the clock.
//
// WHY A HEARTBEAT, NOT A ~24h ONE-SHOT (user report 2026-09-15, restated
// 2026-09-22 "the schedule feature does not work"): the close-time test fired,
// the next-day leave never did. The old design armed a one-shot `when` alarm
// ~24h out and trusted Chrome to deliver it — but Chrome NEVER delivers a
// past-due alarm: a browser closed or a PC asleep at the moment drops the fire
// with no replacement, and even awake, a far-future one-shot is the fragile
// case the search watchdog already abandoned (core/alarms.ts documents the
// same one-shot→periodic lesson). So the clock is no longer "wait for one
// alarm to land at exactly 09:00"; it is "a periodic heartbeat (plus every
// worker wake, plus a punctual alarm for on-time firing) keeps asking the pure
// scheduledDue() check, which fires the moment the wall clock is at or past
// today's time and today hasn't run yet." Delivery reliability stops mattering
// — the wall clock is the source of truth, and a missed heartbeat only delays
// the round to the next tick, never loses the day.
//
// ensureScheduledRun() is idempotent on every worker wake and every settings
// change: it clears both alarms when the toggle is off, creates the heartbeat
// when missing, and re-targets the punctual alarm only when the user moved the
// time. The toggle is OFF by default — a routine that starts itself at nine
// sharp must be opted into, never a fresh-install surprise.
