// The board (6.8.0 rewrite, user request 2026-09-11: "I do not like the
// current layout. And layout handling I want you to start again from
// scratch"): react-grid-layout drives the dashboard now — the ~500 lines of
// hand-rolled grid machinery (flowSeats, dropSpot, the grip pointer math,
// the ghost overlay, the tier measurement) are gone, replaced by this one
// wrapper plus the pure snap/migrate modules.
//
// What the wrapper adds ON TOP of RGL:
// - the registry's DESIGNED STEPS: a constraint funnels every free resize
//   proposal through snapToStep, so a tile only ever lands on a size it was
//   designed for (every reachable size is a designed size);
// - persistence: the board settles → dashLayout {v:2, items} (migrate.ts
//   sanitizes what comes back);
// - edit mode: the Edit layout toggle flips RGL's drag/resize on and shows
//   the grips; Default layout DROPS the stored key (a future default board
//   re-seats itself);
// - the animations setting: RGL's CSS transitions, on or off.
//
// Drag by the tile's HEAD (the Windows/Android idiom), resize by the corner
// grip, vertical compaction keeps the board packed (the 6.7.1 "no blank
// strips" requirement, for free).
